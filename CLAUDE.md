# Pitcher Training Intelligence — Claude Init

> Last updated: 2026-04-19
> Sprint status: Phases 1-20.1 + Sprint 0.5 + Tier 1 Hardening + Redesign Spec 1 complete. Tier 1 landed coach sidebar team-name enrichment, exercise-name hydration at write, canonical morning_brief shape, and snapshot cache for exercises. Spec 1 replaced the generic Tailwind shell with the editorial brand system (UChicago maroon + cream, Source Serif 4 + Inter, Sidebar/Masthead/Scoreboard/Lede/FlagPill/EditorialState/Toast, Vitest + RTL). Page bodies still legacy — Specs 2 and 3 swap them next. Next: Spec 2 page bodies (Team Overview first), Tier 2, The Ledger, weight logging UI.

## What This Is

A training intelligence system for the UChicago baseball pitching staff. Telegram bot + FastAPI API + React Mini App + Coach Dashboard. Each pitcher gets personalized daily programs (lifting, arm care, recovery, throwing), evidence-based Q&A, and longitudinal tracking — driven by their individual profile, injury history, and conversation context.

**Four layers:**
- **Bot (Telegram)** — Conversational input layer. Morning check-ins, post-outing reports, free-text Q&A.
- **Mini App (React)** — Pitcher-facing. Programs, completion tracking, guided day flow, trajectory over time.
- **Coach Dashboard (React)** — Staff-facing. Roster overview, schedule, team programs, phase management, AI-generated insights.
- **Intelligence Engine (Python/FastAPI)** — Triage, plan generation, knowledge retrieval, research resolver, progression analysis.

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Name | Date | Summary |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| 1-5 | Foundation → Polish | 2026-03-28 | Supabase migration, state awareness, coaching quality, visible compounding, bug fixes |
| 6 | WHOOP Integration | 03-29 | Full biometric pipeline: OAuth PKCE, daily pulls, triage integration, WhoopCard UI |
| 7 | Adoption Push | 03-30 | Personalized `/start`, contextual morning notifications, arm feel → check-in flow |
| 8 | Dynamic Exercise Pool | 03-31 | 155-exercise library drives selection. Injury-aware, variety across weeks, explosive block |
| 9 | Exercise Enrichment + Mobility | 03-31 | Library → 155 exercises, 21 mobility videos in 10-week cycling rotation |
| 10 | Day Phases | 03-31 | Dynamic warmup (cuff/scap + FPM addon), tiered post-throw recovery (light/medium/full) |
| 11 | Onboarding UX | 03-31 | Welcome card, coach personalized intro, graceful degradation for sparse profiles |
| 12 | Pitcher Training Model | 04-01 | Consolidated `active_flags` + exercise intelligence + weekly arc into single table |
| 13 | Exercise Swap UI | 04-02 | Inline swap with reason pills, model-aware alternatives, auto-dislike after 3+ swaps |
| 14 | Two-Pass Plan Gen | 04-02 | Python builds instant plan, LLM reviews. No more timeout failures. Weekly model + proactive suggestions |
| 15 | Coach Bridge + Game Detection | 04-02 | Coach chat → mutation preview cards, `/apply-mutations`, game day detection, reliever prompts |
| 16 | Source Tagging + Hardening | 04-09 | Yellow-flag trim fix (7 exercises not 4), plan source/reason tagging, `plan_degraded` status gate |
| 17 | Silent Degradation Monitoring | 04-09 | 9am health digest, real-time emergency alerts (3+ failures/30min), Q&A tracking, admin commands |
| 18 | Guided Day Flow | 04-09 | 5-phase guided sequence (warmup→arm care→lifting→throwing→mobility), completion collapse, "NOW" accent |
| 18a | Swap Dual-Write Fix | 04-09 | `swap_exercise` + `apply_mutations` now search top-level `lifting.exercises` first, write both locations |
| 19 | Research-Aware Coaching | 04-10 | Unified resolver, frontmatter-driven research docs, structured coach chat, morning enrichment, "why" sheet |
| 20 | Coach Dashboard v0 | 04-12 | Full coach-facing app: 7 new DB tables, 30 API endpoints, JWT auth, 6 screens, 13 components. CORS blocker remains |
| 0.5 | Scale Migration | 04-13 | arm_feel/energy rescaled 1-5→1-10 across bot, API, mini-app, coach-app, prompts, data templates. Supabase data migrated ×2. Chart axes reworked. |
| 20.1 | Coach Dashboard Unblock | 04-14 | Coach app live end-to-end. CORS (`COACH_APP_URL=https://baseball-self.vercel.app`), ES256/JWKS JWT validator (`PyJWT[crypto]`), `Shell` children-render fix, `team_scope` schema realignment (`physical`→`physical_profile` dropped, `flag_level`→`current_flag_level`, `injury_history.status` removed). |
| Spec 1 | Coach Dashboard Redesign — Brand System & Shell | 04-19 | Editorial brand shell replaces generic Tailwind shell. `src/styles/tokens.css` adds 28 locked tokens (UChicago maroon `#5c1020` + cream `#f7f1e3`, alert crimson/amber/forest, 10-step type scale). Self-hosted Source Serif 4 (400/600/700 + 400 italic) + Inter. 7 shared components in `src/components/shell/` — `Sidebar`, `TeamBrand`, `Masthead`, `Scoreboard`, `Lede`, `FlagPill`, `EditorialState`, `Toast`. Vitest + RTL added (49 tests, token contract locked). Dev-only `/__design` sandbox w/ axe smoke check (lazy-loaded). `Shell.jsx` and old `Toast.jsx` deleted. Page bodies preserved — Specs 2 and 3 replace them. |

### What's Next
1. **Coach Dashboard Redesign Spec 2** — Replace page bodies with `Scoreboard`-anchored, numbers-first editorial layouts (Team Overview first, then Schedule / Team Programs / Phases / Insights). Auth-exchange `team_name` enrichment already shipped in Tier 1, so `<TeamBrand>` will pick up real team names once the shell is deployed.
2. **Coach Dashboard Redesign Spec 3** — Deferred slide-overs, interaction polish, motion.
3. **Tier 2 hardening** — Continuation of the Tier 1 sprint.
4. **The Ledger** — Modification history timeline on Profile. Data exists in `plan_generated.modifications_applied` + `pitcher_training_model.recent_swap_history`.
5. **Weight logging UI** — `working_weights` column exists, no UI. Unblocks exercise progression curves.
6. **Exercise progression curves** — Volume/intensity trends for key lifts over time. Blocked on weight logging.
7. **Inline coach panel** — Coach button on lifting block for in-context refinement without navigating to Coach tab.

## Key Patterns

### Triage → Plan Pipeline (Critical Path)
1. Rule-based triage (`triage.py`) → green/yellow/red + modification tags from `vocabulary.py`
2. Ambiguous cases → LLM refinement (`triage_llm.py`)
3. **Partial entry saved to Supabase BEFORE plan generation** (data persists even if LLM fails)
4. Dynamic warmup from `dynamic_warmup.json` (cuff/scap activation + FPM addon for injury history)
5. Dynamic exercise pool selects 7-8 lifting exercises + 1 explosive from 159-exercise library
6. Tiered post-throw recovery (light/medium/full) based on throwing day type
7. **Python constructs complete plan** (instant) — always succeeds
8. **LLM reviews plan** (async, 20s timeout) — adjusts prescriptions, writes morning brief. Timeout → Python plan ships as-is
9. Full entry upserted, results persist to `pitcher_training_model`
10. `days_since_outing` incremented AFTER first successful check-in (re-check-ins don't double-increment)
11. Weekly state updated in `pitcher_training_model.current_week_state`
12. Plan tagged with `source` (`python_fallback` | `llm_enriched`) + `source_reason` for observability

**Arm feel scale (1-10, migrated from 1-5 on 2026-04-13):** Critical RED ≤2 (shutdown), RED ≤4, YELLOW trigger ≤6, Green ≥7. Energy low trigger ≤4. Avg trend thresholds: <5.0 low, ≥5.0 solid, ≥7.0 strong. Recovery "back to good" ≥7.

### Exercise Selection (`exercise_pool.py`)
- Filters by: day focus, rotation_day_usage, contraindications, modification_flags
- Prefers exercises NOT used in last 7 days
- **Flag-aware session structure**: GREEN → 2 compounds + 3 accessories + 2 core + 1 explosive = 8. YELLOW → minus 1 accessory = 7. RED → light (1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 4). Check at `exercise_pool.py:172`.
- **Model-aware**: exercise_preferences (dislike → deprioritized), equipment_constraints (hard filter), swap history (3+ swaps → auto-dislike)
- **Phase emphasis hook**: `team_programs.py` can override `training_intent` based on active team phase block
- LLM adjusts prescriptions but CANNOT add exercises outside the pre-selected pool

### DailyCard Rendering — Dual Data Sources (Critical Gotcha)
- Lifting has TWO data sources: `lifting.exercises` (LLM structured plan) and `plan_generated.exercise_blocks` (Python fallback)
- `exercise_blocks` has `block_name` on parent objects — individual exercises do NOT have a `block` field
- `lifting.exercises` has flat exercises with optional `superset_group`
- Block stratification must read from `exercise_blocks` for sub-headers, NOT from individual exercise fields
- Props thread: DailyCard → ExerciseBlock → SupersetList → ExerciseItem — missing a prop silently fails
- Swap overrides: `entry` prop is immutable — use local `swapOverrides` state map

### Swap / Mutation Dual-Write (Critical Gotcha)
- `daily_entries` has **two places** lifting lives: top-level `lifting` column (written by `checkin_service`) AND nested `plan_generated.lifting` (written by `apply_mutations`)
- `swap_exercise` and `apply_mutations` search top-level `entry.lifting.exercises` FIRST, fall back to nested legacy locations, write back BOTH
- Frontend reads: `lifting: entry.lifting || plan_generated?.lifting` — top-level first

### Two-Pass Plan Generation
- Pass 1 (Python) builds `python_plan` — `training_intent`, `day_focus` MUST be defined before the try/except around `build_exercise_pool()`, not inside it
- `active_modifications` is TEXT[] in `pitcher_training_model`. PostgREST handles list↔TEXT[] conversion
- Both timeout and parse-failure paths must have all fields `checkin_service.py` expects
- **`morning_brief` can be string OR dict** — always coerce to string before using in messages. Coercion duplicated in 4 places (tech debt)
- `generate_plan()` returns `python_plan` on any LLM failure — new plan fields must be added to BOTH paths

### Research Resolver (`bot/services/research_resolver.py`)
- **Single door for all surfaces** — `resolve_research(profile, context, triage, user_message, max_chars)`. Context: `plan_gen`, `coach_chat`, `morning`, `daily_plan_why`.
- Each research doc in `data/knowledge/research/` has YAML frontmatter: `id`, `applies_to`, `triggers`, `priority`, `contexts`
- Four-step selection: (1) critical + injury area match, (2) triage mod trigger intersection, (3) keyword match (coach_chat), (4) standard docs for remaining budget
- `should_fire_research()` gates all surfaces: non-green flag OR active modifications OR injury keyword in message
- Logs every call to `research_load_log` table

### Vocabulary (`bot/services/vocabulary.py`)
- `INJURY_AREAS` (8) and `MODIFICATION_TAGS` (14) — single source of truth
- Consumed by: triage (emits tag keys), exercise_pool, research_resolver, plan_generator (`get_mod_description`)

### Coach Dashboard Auth
- Coach app uses Supabase Auth (email/password) → exchanges Supabase JWT for backend validation
- `coach_auth.py`: `require_coach_auth` dependency extracts `supabase_user_id`, looks up `coaches` row, provides `team_id` scope
- All `/api/coach/*` endpoints are team-scoped — a coach only sees their team's data
- `COACH_APP_URL` must be in Railway CORS origins for auth exchange to work
- **JWT signing**: Supabase issues `ES256` (asymmetric) JWTs on newer projects, `HS256` on legacy. `_decode_token()` inspects `alg` and routes to JWKS (`{SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`, cached by `PyJWKClient`) or `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`. `PyJWT[crypto]` extra is required for ES256 verification.
- **Local dev gotcha:** if coach-app login bounces back to `/login` without error, `VITE_API_URL` likely points at a local FastAPI that doesn't have `coach_routes` mounted. Either run `python -m api.main` from `pitcher_program_app/` (with `.env` populated including `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`), or point `VITE_API_URL` at Railway: `https://baseball-production-9d28.up.railway.app`. Supabase issues the JWT fine; the failure is the `/api/coach/auth/exchange` POST returning 404/405, which `useCoachAuth` catches and converts to `coach=null` → redirect to `/login`.

### Coach Dashboard Brand Shell (Spec 1 — 2026-04-19)
- **Tokens live in one place:** `coach-app/src/styles/tokens.css` declares all colors, type sizes, and font families inside a `@theme` block. Tailwind v4 auto-generates utilities (`bg-maroon`, `text-charcoal`, `text-display`, `font-serif`, etc.) from those keys — do NOT hardcode hex values in components.
- **Brand vs alert separation is load-bearing:** `--color-maroon*` / `--color-rose` are brand chrome only; `--color-crimson` / `--color-amber` / `--color-forest` are flag/alert only. Crossing the two breaks the system — if you need a red that isn't a flag, push back.
- **Shared components:** `components/shell/` holds `Sidebar`, `TeamBrand`, `Masthead`, `Scoreboard`, `Lede`, `FlagPill`, `EditorialState`, `Toast`. Every page sits inside `<main>` with a top `<Masthead kicker title date [week] [actionSlot] />`. Scoreboard requires EXACTLY 5 cells (throws otherwise).
- **Contract test:** `components/shell/__tests__/tokens.test.jsx` asserts every brand token name still exists. Run `npm run test:run -- tokens` before touching `tokens.css`.
- **Dev-only sandbox:** `/__design` renders every shell component + runs axe-core. Route is gated by `import.meta.env.DEV` AND `DesignSandbox` is `React.lazy()`-imported so production tree-shakes it. Visit locally in dev mode to smoke-test a11y after shell changes.
- **Toast API:** `useToast()` returns `{ success, warn, error, info }`, each `(msg, ttl?)`. Tone-aware border + bone fill (`shell/Toast.jsx`).
- **Deferred for Specs 2–3:** Page bodies still use legacy layouts (roster cards, grid tables). Spec 2 replaces Team Overview first, anchored by a real `<Scoreboard>`.

### Check-in Flow
- Two paths: Telegram (`daily_checkin.py` → `process_checkin`) and mini-app (`/chat` → `process_checkin`). Mini-app fetch dies at ~60s.
- Morning notification arm feel buttons (1-5) are ConversationHandler entry points → full check-in flow
- `hasCheckedIn` requires actual plan data, not just `pre_training.arm_feel`
- Response assembly in `/chat` path is independently try/except-wrapped

### Template Selection (Lift Preference)
- **Explicit preference always wins**: "upper" → day_3, "lower" → day_2, "rest" → day_6
- **"Your call" / "auto" / empty**: falls back to rotation-based (`days_since_outing` → template day)

### Scheduled Jobs
- Morning check-in at pitcher's `notification_time`
- 6pm follow-up if unanswered
- Sunday 6pm weekly narrative + summary
- 6am daily WHOOP pull (sends re-link if auth expired)
- 9am daily health digest to admin
- 11pm post-game reliever check

### WHOOP Integration
- Per-pitcher OAuth PKCE, tokens in `whoop_tokens`, daily 6am pull → `whoop_daily`
- Check-in always pulls fresh (`force_refresh=True`); 6am pull may get partial data (`PENDING_SCORE` → re-pull later)
- Feeds into triage (`whoop_hrv`, `whoop_hrv_7day_avg`, `whoop_sleep_perf`), plan gen context, weekly narrative
- All code paths handle `whoop_data=None` — non-WHOOP pitchers unaffected

### Dual LLM Routing
- `call_llm()` — fast model (deepseek-chat, 90s timeout) for Q&A, plan review, weekly narrative
- `call_llm_reasoning()` — reasoning model (deepseek-reasoner, 120s timeout) for multi-day protocols
- `return_metadata=True` surfaces `finish_reason` for truncation detection

### Timezone
All dates use `CHICAGO_TZ` (from `bot/config.py`). Server: `datetime.now(CHICAGO_TZ)`. Client: `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'America/Chicago' })`.

### DB Patterns
- `_DAILY_ENTRY_COLUMNS` whitelist in `db.py` strips unknown fields before upsert
- `pitchers` PK is `pitcher_id` (not `id`). FK references must use `REFERENCES pitchers(pitcher_id)`
- `pitcher_training_model` consolidates old `active_flags` + exercise intelligence. `profile["active_flags"]` populated via compat layer in `_profile_from_row()`
- `daily_entries.pre_training` JSONB uses key `overall_energy` (NOT `energy`) — matters for any SQL migration touching energy values

### Exercise library workflow (2026-04-18)
- **Supabase `exercises` is canonical** at runtime. `/api/exercises`, plan gen, swap, and mutations all read live from Supabase via `exercise_pool` (15-min snapshot cache + lazy-miss).
- **JSON is seed-only.** `data/knowledge/exercise_library.json` is the source of truth in git for review/history. A pre-commit hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-commit`) runs `scripts/seed_exercises_from_json.py` on every commit that touches the JSON. Upsert-only — never deletes.
- **Hook install:** one-time `ln -sf ../../pitcher_program_app/scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit` from repo root.
- **Hook failure:** warns + proceeds (D11). Manual re-run: `cd pitcher_program_app && python -m scripts.seed_exercises_from_json`.
- **Removing an exercise:** delete from JSON for new plans, but historical `plan_generated` rows still reference it — orphans in Supabase are tolerated (D12).

### Chart.js Axis Gotcha
With explicit `min`/`max` + `stepSize`, Chart.js silently adds `max` as an extra tick when `max` isn't on the stepSize grid (produces spurious labels like "11/10"). For dot headroom at y=max, use chart-level `clip: false` + `layout.padding.top` — do NOT inflate `max` to create space. Example in `SeasonTimeline.jsx` and `SleepScatter.jsx`.

### Handler Registration
`register_handlers(application)` in `bot/main.py` is the **single source of truth** for all bot handlers. Both `main.py` (local) and `run.py` (Railway) call it. **Add new commands here only.**

## Deployment

### Architecture
```
GitHub (landonbrice/baseball)
  └─ pitcher_program_app/
       ├─ bot/ + api/              ← Python backend (Railway)
       ├─ mini-app/                ← Pitcher frontend (Vercel)
       ├─ coach-app/               ← Coach dashboard (Vercel, separate project)
       └─ data/                    ← JSON (read-only, Supabase is primary)
```

### Railway (Bot + API)
- Single process: `Procfile: web: python -m bot.run`
- Root directory: `pitcher_program_app`
- Auto-deploy on push to `main`

### Vercel (Mini App)
- Root: `pitcher_program_app/mini-app`, Vite, `npm run build` → `dist/`
- Env: `VITE_API_URL=https://baseball-production-9d28.up.railway.app`

### Vercel (Coach App)
- Root: `pitcher_program_app/coach-app`, Vite
- URL: `baseball-self.vercel.app`
- Env: `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **CORS**: `COACH_APP_URL` in Railway must match exactly (no trailing slash)

### Supabase
- Project: `pitcher-training-intel` (us-east-1)
- URL: `https://beyolhukpbvvoxvjnwtd.supabase.co`
- FK pattern: `pitchers` PK is `pitcher_id` (not `id`)

### Deploy Checklist
1. Push to `main` → Railway + Vercel auto-deploy
2. New Supabase tables/columns → apply migration first via MCP or dashboard
3. New env vars → update in Railway/Vercel dashboards
4. Verify: bot `/checkin`, API health, mini-app loads in Telegram

### Data Safety
- **Supabase is source of truth.** JSON files are read-only fallback.
- **JSONB guard pattern:** `(x.get("field") or {}).get()` in Python, `Array.isArray()`/`typeof` in React.

### Running Locally
```bash
cd pitcher_program_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m bot.run           # Bot + API in one process (same as Railway)
cd mini-app && npm run dev  # Mini-app (separate terminal)
cd coach-app && npm run dev # Coach app (separate terminal)
```
No Python virtualenv locally — project runs on Railway. Use Supabase MCP for SQL operations.

## Known Issues & Tech Debt

- **Schema drift in `team_scope.py`** — file was written against an older schema (used `physical`/`pitching`/`flag_level`/`injury_history.status`). Realigned 2026-04-14. Follow-up sweep across `bot/services/` + `api/` (2026-04-14) confirmed no other offenders: remaining `flag_level` references are all triage-result dict keys, `daily_entries.pre_training` JSONB keys, or legitimate `injury_history.flag_level` column reads. `physical_profile`/`pitching_profile` already consistent.
- **FastAPI unhandled-exception responses skip CORS middleware** — a 500 from an uncaught exception surfaces as "Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin" in Safari/Chrome, even though CORS is correctly configured. Always check Railway logs for the real traceback before chasing CORS.
- **Repo bloat from untracked dev artifacts** — `graphify-out/`, `past_arm_programs/*.xlsx`, root-level `scripts/`, `ui-elevation-mockup.jsx` have leaked into commits. Need proper `.gitignore` + `git rm --cached` pass.
- `morning_brief` string/dict coercion duplicated in 4 places — should normalize at checkin_service boundary
- `context_manager.py:173` `msg.get("content","")[:200]` — no `str()` coercion, latent TypeError if content is dict
- 10 exercises missing YouTube links (ex_121-123, ex_126-128, ex_156-159)
- `_load_exercise_library()` module-level cache — new exercises require Railway redeploy
- `/api/staff/pulse` returns 500 intermittently — undiagnosed crash in pitcher loop
- Guided flow `manuallyDonePhases` is ephemeral (resets on reload) — v2 deferral
- Dev commands (`/testnotify`, `/whooptest`, `/healthdigest`, `/testemergency`) exist — remove before broader rollout
- Reliever template uses text descriptions not exercise IDs — not validated
- `data_sync.py` disabled but still exists — can delete
- **Coach-app redesign carryovers (post-Spec 1):**
  - `TODAY` constant duplicated verbatim in 5 pages — extract to `coach-app/src/utils/formatToday.js` in Spec 2
  - `"Chicago · Pitching Staff"` kicker hardcoded in 6 sites — will feed from `coach.team_name` once auth-exchange enrichment merges
  - `TeamPrograms` Masthead has no `actionSlot` because the plan's `__new__` sentinel didn't exist server-side; Spec 2 should wire a real "+ New Program" entry point through the assign modal
  - `Schedule.jsx` still uses inline `"Loading schedule..."` string instead of `<EditorialState type="loading">` — cosmetic inconsistency, Spec 2 page swap will fix
  - `alert()` / `confirm()` calls in `Phases` + `TeamPrograms` predate Spec 1; now that `useToast` exists they should migrate to `toast.error` / inline confirmation
  - `<Sidebar>` Sign out `<button>` missing `type="button"` (no form context, no functional bug)

## Bot Scope Boundaries

**Owns:** Lifting programs, arm care, plyocare, recovery, readiness triage, Q&A, longitudinal tracking, program modifications based on injury/biometrics.

**Does NOT own:** Mechanical instruction, medical diagnosis, supplement recommendations. Flags concerns → tells pitcher to see trainer.
